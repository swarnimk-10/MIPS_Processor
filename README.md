# MIPS 5-Stage Pipelined Processor (32-bit) - Verilog Implementation

This repository contains a complete Verilog implementation of a **32-bit MIPS processor with a classic 5-stage pipeline architecture**. The design mimics real-world MIPS instruction execution using **instruction-level parallelism**, focusing on performance and modularity.  
Ideal for learning processor design, pipelining concepts, and preparing for core VLSI interviews.

## Theory Overview

The **MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages)** architecture is a RISC-based instruction set known for its simplicity and efficiency. The pipelined implementation increases throughput by overlapping instruction execution stages.

### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Instruction Fetch (IF):**

Fetches instruction from memory using the Program Counter (PC).

2. **Instruction Decode/Register Fetch (ID):**

Decodes the instruction and reads register values.

3. **Execute (EX):**

Performs arithmetic or logic operations in the ALU.

7. **Memory Access (MEM):**

Accesses data memory for load/store instructions.

9. **Write Back (WB):**

Writes the result back to the register file.
